Project developped at "chemin_froid" to get periodic readings from weighing scales.

It controls different weighing devices:
- 60kg or 6kg RadWag weighing scale
- 60kg DGTPAN weighing scale
- a ÂµC (ESP32) that is itself programmed to drive an HX711 chip and a load cell (50 kg RadWag missing screen weighing scale ).
